            <dt>Match history</dt>
                <dd>This is the games most recent update. Previous to this there was no first party way of seeing your previous games
                    there is now a dedicated menu that lets you see the scoreline of your last 20 games, along with allowing you to download the replay of said games.
                </dd>
                <dd>Generaly this update has been taken well, it eases the saving of replays and allows players to more easily reflect on their performance</dd>
            
            <dt>Demo cam</dt>
                <dd>This is the newest update to the games actual gameplay, you now get a quick preview of which side of the pitch you will respawn on after getting demolitioned.</dd>
                <dd>This update has been taken well, especially in the professional scene due to the fact of it removing luck in the game and allowing for more skill. However some complain that this is essentially a "nerf" to demos.</dd>
            
            <dt>Boost meter</dt>
                <dd>This is the second newest feature added to gameplay. Now players can see how much boost their teammates have by looking at a small boost meter that appears in teammates name tags on the pitch.</dd>
                <dd>This feature was taken well, pros like the fact that they now do not need to communicate their boost amounts to their teammates, freeing up comms for better team gameplay</dd>

            <dt>Trade ban</dt>
                <dd>This feature was added by Epic games after their aquisition of Psyonix in an attempt to get more money out of the player base by making players purchase skins dirctly from them rather than trading with eachother</dd>
                <dd>This was a terrible update to the game and has been taken poorly by the whole community, this was a removal of a big part of the game to many people and nullifies the value of any items in the game</dd>

        <h3>Competitive scene</h3>
        <p>The RLCS (Rocket League Championship series) has a rich history and has been running since 2016
        The best source of history for the rlcs is via the <a href="https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Rocket_League_Championship_Series">Liquipedia site</a> which has a detailed account of all RLCS events to have occured over the last 8 years.
        Before COVID in 2020 the RLCS ran in a league style format, having 2 in person world championships per year. However during covid these championships could not occur due to social distancing regulations,
        Instead RLCS season X ran with multiple online tournaments. This was a pivotal point in the RLCS as after COVID restrictions were lifted the RLCS decided to move into the "Open era" where teams had to qualify for RLCS events through completely open qualkifiers.
        This has allowed for the development of new and talented upcomming players to occur much more easily. One of the first instances of this was "Team Queso" who busrt onto the scene in 2022 coming 2nd in the first "major" of the open era and winning the second.
        While the format of the open era is changing year by year it generally follows the following format. Per "split" there are 3 qualifier events to gain points to go to the LAN major, There are then 2-3 splits per year where teams gain points to qualify for the World championships at the end of the year.
        Due to the fact that there is only one world championship per year compared to the previous 2 they are seen to be much more prestigious. There have now been 3 world championships in the open era, with 2 of them being won by "Team BDS" with the player "M0nkeyM00n" being on the team both times,
        the team also came 2nd in the other world championships. Due to this the team is seen as the most winning team of all time, with M0nkeyM00n being condisered one of if not the best player of all time</p>
